# Visualizing-Titanic-Survivers-Data

This repository contains a notebook which visualizes the data taken from Kaggle of the people who were on board on Titanic on day of the accident.

From analyzing the data, following inferences were made:

1. If a person has spend more than 33 dollars, chances of his/her survival are almost twice than the person who spend less than 33 dollars.

2. 64% of people who survived were less than 30 years in age.

3. A child less than 10 years in age has 3 times more chances of survival than a person belonging to age group of 60-70.

4. A girl child and a boy child below age of 10 have the same probability of survival. Whereas, a lady is roughly 5 times more likely than man to survive the accident.

5. A third of the people that boarded from Southampton survived the incident which accounts for 61% of people who survived. 40% people boarding from Queenstown were alive after the accident which accounts for less than 10% people that managed to live that day.

6. 250 people who survived the accident were travelling either alone, or with just 1 family member. A family consists of total number of siblings, spouses, parents and children. This figure accounts for almost 74% of the surviving people.
